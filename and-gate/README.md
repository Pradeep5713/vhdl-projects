# AND Gate VHDL Project

This project implements a simple AND gate in VHDL with a testbench for simulation.

## Files

- **and_gate.vhd**: The VHDL source file implementing the AND gate logic
- **and_gate_tb.vhd**: The testbench file for simulating and testing the AND gate

## Description

The AND gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that outputs a '1' only when both inputs are '1'.

### Truth Table

| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

## How to Use

1. Load both `and_gate.vhd` and `and_gate_tb.vhd` into your VHDL simulator
2. Compile the design files
3. Run the testbench simulation
4. Observe the waveforms to verify the AND gate behavior
